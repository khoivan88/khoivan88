I am an organic chemist who writes apps and creates websites!!

## A few of the websites that I created:

- [https://organicchemistrydata.org/](https://organicchemistrydata.org/): a supplemental website launched by the Division of Organic Chemistry (DOC) in Sept 2020 for a collection of organic chemistry data.
- [https://organicchemistrydata.org/hansreich/](https://organicchemistrydata.org/hansreich/): an archive of the late Professor Hans Reich‚Äôs (University of Wisconsin - Madison) web collection, transferred and currently being maintained by the DOC. While I did not create the content (~ 700 HTML pages) of this collection, the original materials were converted to a mobile-friendly format to work well for users from desktops, laptop, tablets and cell phones.
- [https://eluenttranslator.netlify.app](https://eluenttranslator.netlify.app): a web utility to estimate a solvent mixture composition that would give similar eluent strength for chromatography
- [https://acs-s21-orgn.netlify.app/dates/](https://acs-s21-orgn.netlify.app/dates/): a website to display a schedule of presentations in the ORGN track that were listed by date (for better viewing compared to the original ACS Spring 2021 scheduler). The content of the website was automatically extracted and updated 4 times/ day from the ACS Spring 2021 website.
- [https://cs50w-pro1.herokuapp.com/](https://cs50w-pro1.herokuapp.com/): a website contains a database of 5000 books with links to GoodReads and OpenLibrary.org databases. Users will be able to register for website and then log in using their username and password. Once they log in, they will be able to search for books, leave reviews for individual books, and see the reviews made by other people. A third-party API by Goodreads, another book review website, is also used to pull in ratings from a broader audience.
- [https://doyouknowwhenyouwillgraduate.netlify.app/](https://doyouknowwhenyouwillgraduate.netlify.app/): a fun little website for any graduate student dealing with people keep asking them when they will graduate.
- [https://open-enventory.gitbook.io/user-guides/](https://open-enventory.gitbook.io/user-guides/): Open Enventory User guides

## A few of apps that I created:

- [https://github.com/khoivan88/find_sds](https://github.com/khoivan88/find_sds): Find safety data sheet (SDS) for chemicals using their CAS numbers
- [https://github.com/khoivan88/pka_lookup](https://github.com/khoivan88/pka_lookup): Python script to lookup pKa values, current database of at least 7300 values
- [https://github.com/khoivan88/open_enventory-modified_for_US](https://github.com/khoivan88/open_enventory-modified_for_US): modified version of Open Enventory, free open-source Chemical Inventory and ELN
